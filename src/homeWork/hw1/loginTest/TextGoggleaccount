- Prior to the actual scripting, we need to import the above packages:

* import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver – References the WebDriver interface which is
required to instantiate a new web browser.

* import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver – References the FirefoxDriver
class that is required instantiate a Firefox specific driver on the browser instance
instantiated using WebDriver interface.

* import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement – References to the WebElement class which
is required to instantiate a new web element.

* import org.openqa.selenium.By – References to the By class on which a locator
type is called.


- Launching the Web browser

* driver.get(url);
A get() method is called on the WebDriver instance to launch a fresh web browser instance.
The string character sequence passed as a parameter into the get() method redirects the launched
web browser instance to the application URL.


- Maximize Browser Window

* driver.manage().window().maximize();
The maximize() method is used to maximize the browser window soon after it is re-directed
to the application URL.


- Fetch the page Title

* driver.getTitle();
The getTitle() method is used to fetch the title of the current web page.
Thus, the fetched title can be loaded to a string variable.


- WebElement Instantiation

* WebElement username = driver.findElement(By.id(“Email”));
In the above statement, we instantiate the WebElement reference with the help of
“driver.findElement(By.id(“Email”))”. Thus, username can be used to reference the Email
textbox on the user interface every time we want to perform some action on it.

- Clear Command

* username.clear();
The clear() method/command is used to clear the value present in the textbox if any.
It also clears the default placeholder value.


- sendKeys Command

* username.sendKeys(“TestSelenium “);
The sendKeys() method/command is used to enter/type the specified value (within the parentheses )
in the textbox. Notice that the sendKeys() method is called on the WebElement object
which was instantiated with the help of element property corresponding to the UI element.
The above block of code enters the string “TestSelenium” inside the Email textbox on the Gmail application.
sendKeys is one of the most popularly used commands across the WebDriver scripts.


- Click Command

* SignInButton.click();
Like sendKeys(), click() is another excessively used command to interact with the web elements.
Click() command/method is used to click on the web element present on the web page.
The above block of code clicks on the “Sign in” button present on the Gmail application.


- Close the Web Browser

* driver.close();
The close() is used to close the current browser window.


- Terminate the Java Program

* System.exit(0);
The Exit() method terminates the Java program forcefully.
Thus, remember to close all the browser instances prior terminating the Java Program.
